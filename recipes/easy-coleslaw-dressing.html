    <p>This creamy, mayo-based dressing uses ingredients 
    you likely have on hand: sugar, lemon juice, vinegar,
     salt, pepper, and of course, mayonnaise. The resulting
      dressing is just the right balance of sweet, tangy,
       creamy, and peppery!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mayonnaise: For a creamy coleslaw, as opposed to vinegar-based, mayonnaise is essential. Use your favorite store brand or make your own!</li>
        <li>Sugar: A sweetener is necessary to balance out the tang of the vinegar and the acidity of the lemon. This recipe calls for standard white sugar, but honey or maple syrup may also be used.</li>
        <li>Lemon juice: Not all coleslaw dressing calls for lemon juice, but it helps to amp up the flavor and add some brightness.</li>
        <li>Vinegar: Vinegar is the primary source of coleslaw's signature tang. Use either apple cider vinegar or white vinegar.</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper: Bring it all home with a little salt and pepper! No need to get fancy with seasonings, the simplicity of this recipe is what makes it so good.</li>
    </ul>
